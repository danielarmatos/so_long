# So Long


The so_long project is part of the curriculum at 42 school and serves as an introduction to graphic programming and game development, challenging students to create a simple 2D game using the C programming language and the Minilibx graphics library. The game involves navigating a player character through a maze-like environment, collecting items.

&nbsp;

### Game rules:

* The player’s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape chosing the shortest possible route;

* The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character;

* The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right;

* The player should not be able to move into walls;

* At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell;

* The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free  space;

* The map can be composed of only these 5 characters: 0 for an empty space, 1 for a wall, C for a collectible,  E for a map exit, P for the player’s starting position;

* The map must contain 1 exit, at least 1 collectible, and 1 starting position to be valid;

* The map must be rectangular;

* The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it’s not, the program must return  an error;

* There has to be a valid path in the map;
 
* If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program exits in a clean way, and returns an error message.
